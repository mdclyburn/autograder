This module provides utilities that allow for enumerating through student
submissions.

stdout - ASCII encoded string of the stdout of the process
stderr - ASCII encoded string of the stderr of the process
return - integer return code from the process
time - floating point value corresponding to the runtime
error - true if the process was killed/errored out
passed - integer number of test cases passed
failed - integer number of test cases failed
skipped - integer number of test cases skipped
errors - integer number of tests cases ending in an error
total - integer sum of the previous 4 values
earned - integers number of points earned
possible - integer number of points possible

students structure:
[
  {
    "directory": "example",
    "email": "example@foobar.com",
    "username": "example"
  },
  {...},
  ...
]

directory - string corresponding to the path to the repo on disk
email - string corresponding to the students email address
username - string corresponding to the students username
